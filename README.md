# vim-pivo

Note: Right now this is our hack-ish VimL playground. It's not even ready in 1%.

## About

`vim-pivo` is a plugin to Vim text editor which will allow to manage Pivotal Tracker stories right inside Vim. No more leaving your favorite editor to visit point'n'click land of web browsers just to start a new task. Also, you will be able to mark one task as what we call _the current_ and it will be added to your Git commit message in format: `[#<task_id]` so your manager will be kept happy.

## Configuration

You need to install [pivotal-tracker](https://github.com/jsmestad/pivotal-tracker) gem first:

```
sudo gem install pivotal-tracker
```

Set following variables in your `.vimrc`:

```
let g:PivoProjectId  = "PROJECT_ID" " ability to change projects on the fly... well, maybe soon
let g:PivoApiToken   = "API_KEY"
```

### Contributing

Those are only some hacks gathered during our hackaton. When we fix all the issues and solve all the crimes, we may even increase the version number to 0.1.0 - who knows.
